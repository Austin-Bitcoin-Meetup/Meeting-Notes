**This week in Debunking Fud:**



*   [Quantum Computing](https://endthefud.org/)
    *   Is it a risk to the network?
        *   Basically, ECDSA is compromised but hashing isn't. With a quantum computer, you could easily deduce the private key corresponding to a public key. Most addresses now are hashed public keys. This is why it’s important to use updated address formats.
        *   Don’t reuse addresses.
    *   All modern mining equipment would become obsolete.
    *   Many other more likely targets exist
        *   Weapons systems
        *   Existing financial network/stock exchanges
    *   Is Bitcoin a canary that Satoshi released into the coal mine?
